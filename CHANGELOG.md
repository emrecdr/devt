# Changelog

All notable changes to devt will be documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.9.3] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Smoke suite CLI coverage**: `scripts/smoke-test.sh` now exercises all 9 CLI subcommands. Before: `init`, `state`, `config`, `models`, `update` (5 of 9). After: adds `health`, `semantic status`, `report window`, `setup --template blank` — closes silent-regression gap on 4 untested subcommands. Suite goes from 11 to 16 checks
- **Agent size-budget guard**: smoke suite enforces a 500-line hard cap on `agents/*.md` files. Largest agent at release is 387 lines, so the check is forward-looking — it prevents agent prompt bloat without forcing any current cleanup. Bump deliberately if a new agent legitimately needs more

### Documented
- **Agent budget convention**: `CLAUDE.md` Key Conventions now states the 500-line agent limit and rationale (extract sub-skills or references when a prompt grows past the cap)

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **CI smoke suite**: `scripts/smoke-test.sh` exercises 11 CLI checks (manifest parse, init/state/config/models/update return JSON, 50 KB cap rejection, concurrent locking) in a temp project. Wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml` across Node 22 and 24
- **CI version coherence check**: GitHub Actions job asserts `VERSION`, `plugin.json` `version`, and the README badge stay in lock-step. Drift fails the build
- **CI workflow_type registry check**: Asserts every entry in `VALID_WORKFLOW_TYPES` has a routing rule in `next.md`, preventing the kind of drift that would silently break resume after pause
- **Concurrent locking test**: New `scripts/test-locking.cjs` spawns 20 parallel writers against a shared `workflow.yaml` and asserts no lost updates and no orphaned `.lock` file. Documents that `acquireLock` / `releaseLock` (`bin/modules/state.cjs:326-389`) actually serialize. Runs in the smoke suite

### Documented
- **Memory-skill boundary**: `skill-index.yaml` header now distinguishes `scratchpad` (ephemeral, within-workflow, resets between runs) from `lesson-extraction` (permanent, cross-workflow, scored playbook entries) at the orchestrator-facing layer. Before: the boundary was only inside each `SKILL.md`. After: an editor adding a third memory skill sees the routing rule before they pick a name

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Task length cap**: `init.cjs` now rejects task descriptions over 50 KB with a clear error. Defense-in-depth against accidental prompt bloat from oversized inputs
- **Hook profile reference**: `CLAUDE.md` now includes a table mapping every hook script to the `minimal`/`standard`/`full` profiles, so users no longer need to read `run-hook.js` source to understand which hooks fire

### Changed
- **`scanDevRules` hardening**: Now uses `validatePath` from `security.cjs` for confinement, skips symlinks and dotfiles, rejects names containing path separators. Resolves long-standing semgrep CWE-22 warnings on the recursive directory walk
- **`ARTIFACT_SCHEMA` comment honesty**: Rewrote the comment in `state.cjs` to enumerate the schema's intentional scope. Before: claimed only 3 artifacts were excluded. After: explains that ~18 artifacts (JSON/YAML state, persistent cross-phase artifacts, free-form markdown) are excluded by design — only markdown artifacts with `## Status:` lines that drive routing belong here

### Documented
- **`quality-gate-verifier.md` is opt-in**: Clarified in `CLAUDE.md` that this is a per-project template projects wire into their own `.claude/settings.json`, not auto-registered in `hooks.json`
- **`skills-workspace/` purpose**: Added one-line mention that this directory holds autoskill trigger-evaluation fixtures (already gitignored)
- **Enforce-mode roadmap**: Added a `TODO (post-1.0)` comment in `state.cjs` documenting the future `DEVT_VALIDATE_ENFORCE=1` mode that would block on shadow-validation mismatches instead of just warning

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **`<self_check>` on 7 agents**: code-reviewer, architect, verifier, docs-writer, retro, curator, researcher — agents now self-verify outputs before completion
- **`<deviation_rules>` on 7 agents**: standardized escalation when agents detect issues outside their lane. READ-ONLY agents (code-reviewer→NEEDS_WORK, architect→BLOCKED, verifier→FAILED, researcher→NEEDS_CONTEXT, retro→DONE_WITH_CONCERNS) report-don't-fix; SCOPED-WRITE agents (docs-writer, curator) get bounded auto-fix authority
- **Artifact content schema validation**: `state.cjs` extracts and validates `## Status:` lines against per-artifact whitelists. New mismatch reasons: `invalid_status`, `no_status_line`, `unreadable`, `missing`
- **Shadow-mode state validation**: `state update` auto-runs `validateConsistency` and emits stderr warnings on mismatch. `_validation` attached to the JSON response. Disable with `DEVT_VALIDATE_SHADOW=0`
- **Persisted validation flag**: `workflow.yaml` now persists `validation_status="warned"` and `validation_warnings=N` when content-schema mismatches are detected. `next.md` routing surfaces the flag so resume can react to it. Cleared actively when an update has zero mismatches
- **Specify ambiguity score**: `specify` step 5 computes a 5-dimension 0-10 ambiguity score (placeholder scan, internal consistency, scope focus, ambiguity, completeness — 0-2 each). Soft-gate `AskUserQuestion` at <8 lets the user refine or accept-and-proceed before the spec is finalized

## [0.8.2] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **CLAUDE.md docs audit**: Added missing `scratchpad.md` artifact to state flow documentation, added 5 undocumented `update` subcommands (local-version, install-type, dirty, clear-cache, changelog), expanded `update.cjs` module description

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Parameterized SQL in semantic.cjs**: Replaced string-interpolated DELETE with `db.prepare().run()` in compact — consistent with INSERT which already used prepared statements
- **syncState consistency**: Refactored workflow_type inference to scan INPUT_ARTIFACTS into `foundSet` — all artifact checks now go through one mechanism instead of mixing `foundSet.has()` with ad-hoc `existsSync`
- **Silent skip on malformed state args**: `state update` now warns when key=value pairs lack `=` instead of silently skipping

### Added
- **W014 health check**: Validates `next.md` routing table covers every entry in `VALID_WORKFLOW_TYPES` — prevents drift when adding new workflow types
- **PHASE_ARTIFACT_MAP / INPUT_ARTIFACTS documentation**: Comments now explain the design boundary (phase-ordered vs cross-workflow) and document artifact origins

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **`--tdd` flag**: Test-driven development mode for dev workflow — reverses implement/test phase order, auto-injects tdd-patterns skill into programmer and tester agents
- **`--dry-run` flag**: Preview the workflow pipeline (tier, steps, agents, models) without executing any agents
- **Acceptance criteria gate**: STANDARD+ tiers check for spec.md with acceptance criteria before implementation — options to define now, auto-derive, or skip verification
- **Enhanced statusline**: Compact format showing tier, phase, iteration, active flags, and task in `UserPromptSubmit` hook. Idle state shows last workflow context.
- **`state prune` subcommand**: Remove orphaned artifacts from `.devt/state/` using `PHASE_ARTIFACT_MAP`. Supports `--dry-run` for safe preview.
- **Tier-based context limiting**: SIMPLE/STANDARD tiers load only relevant state artifacts into agent prompts, reducing context waste

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **JSONC config support**: `readJsonSafe` now strips `//` and `/* */` comments before parsing — config files can include inline documentation
- **Model alias resolution**: `MODEL_ALIAS_MAP` maps short names (opus/sonnet/haiku) to full Anthropic model IDs. New CLI subcommands: `models resolve`, `models list`, `models table`
- **Strict injection scanning**: Shannon entropy analysis for encoded payloads, URL-encoded (`%XX`) and HTML entity (`&lt;` / `&#xNN;`) decode-and-rescan, zero-width Unicode character detection
- **State sync recovery**: `devt-tools state sync` reconstructs `workflow.yaml` from artifact presence on disk — recovery mechanism for corrupted or missing state
- **Phase control flags**: `--to <phase>`, `--only <phase>`, `--chain` for granular autonomous workflow control. New state keys: `stop_at_phase`, `only_phase`
- **Read-before-edit guard hook**: Advisory `PreToolUse` hook reminds agents to read files before editing (async, non-blocking)
- **Domain probes reference**: Structured probing techniques for uncovering domain unknowns, consumed by specify and clarify workflows
- **Severity-tagged golden rules**: `[CRITICAL]`, `[WARNING]`, `[STYLE]` severity levels on all 11 rules for prioritization under turn pressure
- **Researcher provenance tagging**: Every claim requires `[codebase: file:line]`, `[docs: URL]`, or `[inference]` source tags
- **Verifier later-phase awareness**: Level 5.5 filters gaps explicitly deferred to later phases, annotated as `[DEFERRED]` (informational, does not downgrade verdict)
- **Playwright E2E patterns**: Visual regression, accessibility testing, network inspection, locator strategy, and MCP integration sections in typescript-node and vue-bootstrap templates
- **Prompt injection scan**: URL-encoded injection detection (category 7) and Cyrillic homoglyph/lookalike detection (category 8)
- **References directory**: New `references/` supporting layer documented in CLAUDE.md

### Fixed
- **`PHASE_ARTIFACT_MAP` arch_health mismatch**: `arch_health` was mapped to `arch-review.md` (belongs to `architect` phase) — corrected to `arch-health-scan.md` and added `architect` entry
- **`HTML_NAMED_ENTITIES` per-call allocation**: Hoisted from function body to module-level constant in security.cjs
- **Pre-ES2021 `split().join()` idiom**: Replaced with `replaceAll()` in `decodeHtmlEntities` (project requires Node 22+)
- **`syncState` redundant early check**: Removed `existsSync` guard that contradicted subsequent `ensureStateDir()` call
- **Read-before-edit hook blocking**: Changed from `async: false` to `async: true` — advisory hooks should not block tool execution

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Vue-bootstrap template**: form handling (ref + error object), permission-based rendering (computed + authStore), toast composable wrapper, shallowRef vs ref guidance, multi-env config, legacy Options API migration note
- **Vue-bootstrap template**: UI/UX quality standards (WCAG 2.2 AA: touch targets, focus states, contrast ratios, reduced-motion), responsive design checklist, diagnostic grep commands
- **Vue-bootstrap template**: 6 new code smells (div-as-button, missing loading states, stale permission checks, empty states, hardcoded transitions, direct toast calls)
- **Vue-bootstrap template**: architecture additions (constants 4-file pattern, API client architecture, theme/layout system)
- **All 15 skills**: "When NOT to Use" sections, time budget hints, concrete examples for edge cases
- **State validate/sync**: `devt-tools state validate` cross-references state claims against actual artifact files — detects drift when sessions drop mid-workflow (W013 health check)
- **Research gate**: planning blocks when research has unresolved open questions — presents them for resolve/defer/proceed decision
- **Scope reduction detection**: verifier Level 5 extracts every requirement from spec/plan, flags omissions as SCOPE_REDUCED forcing GAPS_FOUND verdict
- **Claim provenance tagging**: programmer, tester, code-reviewer artifacts now include Agent/Model/Timestamp provenance — verifier treats provenance-tagged claims as self-reported
- **Prompt injection defense**: 10→20 patterns covering forget-instructions, act-as, system prompt extraction, `<<SYS>>` markers, exfiltration, tool manipulation. Added strict mode (zero-width Unicode, prompt stuffing) and `sanitizeForDisplay()`
- **Atomics.wait lock**: replaced CPU-spinning busy-wait with `Atomics.wait()` for lock retry — blocks thread without burning cycles
- **Config key warnings**: `getMergedConfig()` warns on unknown keys in `.devt/config.json` (catches typos like `agent_skils`)
- **Questioning guide**: "The Goal" framing, concrete AskUserQuestion examples, option modification tip, expanded freeform rule with wrong/right pairs, decision gate pattern, 2 new anti-patterns
- **Model profiles**: `devt-tools models table [profile]` renders box-drawn agent→model table for diagnostics
- **Autonomous chain flag**: `--autonomous` workflows auto-advance to `/devt:ship` after completion; stale flag cleared on manual invocation
- **Parallel docs + retro**: docs-writer and retro agents now dispatch simultaneously (independent outputs), saving ~30-60s per STANDARD workflow
- **All 15 skills**: optimized descriptions for triggering accuracy with explicit trigger phrases and negative boundaries

### Fixed
- **UserPromptSubmit hook error**: `workflow-context-injector.sh` emitted empty line when no workflow was active, causing Claude Code to fail JSON parsing — now outputs nothing when idle
- **Stale `stopped_at`/`stopped_phase` on resume**: all 10 workflows now clear these fields when setting `active=true`, preventing misleading session-start banners and false W006 health alerts
- **`next.md` missing post-implementation routes**: added routing for impl-summary without review (→ `/devt:review`) and review with NEEDS_WORK verdict (→ resume `/devt:workflow`)
- **Missing `<agent_skills>` in 2 dispatch templates**: `debug.md` debugger and `create-plan.md` architect dispatches now include skill injection tag
- **`specify.md` decisions format**: extracted decisions now use DEC-xxx ID format matching `clarify-task.md`, enabling cross-workflow traceability
- **Quick-implement stale comment**: review iteration comparison updated from "vs 3" to "vs 5 (RETRY/DECOMPOSE/PRUNE)"
- **Verifier status enum incomplete**: added `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` to formal output format (was already produced via turn-limit awareness but undocumented)
- **`next.md` NEEDS_WORK route accuracy**: corrected misleading "resume at implement phase" — workflow restarts from context_init, not mid-phase
- **`next.md` APPROVED_WITH_NOTES**: merged with APPROVED route — both are ship-ready verdicts
- **`next.md` unreadable verdict**: added route for interrupted/partial review.md with user prompt
- **Stale `verdict`/`repair`/`verify_iteration` on fresh workflow**: dev-workflow and quick-implement now reset these fields in context_init to prevent carry-over from prior runs
- **Hook `echo` portability**: replaced `echo "$RESULT"` with `printf '%s\n'` to avoid flag interpretation risk
- **`agent_skills` placeholder inconsistency**: normalized debug.md and create-plan.md to use the standard placeholder text

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Simplify workflow phase** (STANDARD + COMPLEX tiers): runs `/simplify` (3 parallel review agents for reuse, quality, efficiency) after tests pass, re-runs quality gates to verify, then proceeds to code review
- Programmer agent self-review now includes explicit simplification pass (reuse, redundancy, over-engineering, dead code checks) integrated into the `<self_review>` section
- `effort` field on all 10 agents: `high` for critical agents (programmer, tester, code-reviewer, verifier, architect, debugger), `medium` for support agents (docs-writer, retro, curator, researcher)
- State tracking (`active=true`, `phase`, `status=IN_PROGRESS/DONE`) added to standalone workflows: `debug.md`, `lesson-extraction.md`, `arch-health-scan.md` — enables `/devt:status` and `/devt:next` resume detection
- `<deviation_rules>` block added to `create-plan.md` (was the only workflow missing it)
- Programmer agent now reads `guardrails/generative-debt-checklist.md` — BEFORE/DURING/AFTER coding gates
- Tester agent now reads `guardrails/golden-rules.md` — scan-before-implementing applies to test code
- Code-reviewer agent now reads `guardrails/golden-rules.md` — reviews against universal rules
- `scripts/run-quality-gates.sh` and `scripts/check-docs.sh` moved from `harness/` to `scripts/` and wired into quality-gate-verifier

### Fixed
- **`run-hook.js` silent hook bypass**: spawn failure or timeout (status=null) now detected via `result.error` check and exits with code 1 instead of silently succeeding. Uses `??` instead of `||` for null-safe exit code
- **`semantic.cjs` crash on Node < 22.5**: `require("node:sqlite")` wrapped in try/catch with friendly error message showing required version
- **`security.cjs` dead code**: wired into `init.cjs` — task descriptions are now scanned for prompt injection patterns and sanitized via `sanitizeForPrompt()` before entering agent prompts
- **`stop.sh` performance**: collapsed 2 node spawns (parse + extract) into 1 with `IFS` parsing, eliminated intermediate `WORKFLOW_STATE` variable. Task descriptions sanitized to prevent newline-based IFS splitting
- **`subagent-status.sh` race condition**: `status.json` now uses atomic write (tmp + rename) matching project convention. Switched from `readFileSync('/dev/stdin')` to `process.argv[1]` for consistency
- **`state.cjs` VALID_PHASES**: added `debug`, `arch_health_scan`, `simplify` phases
- **`code-reviewer.md` numbering**: fixed duplicate item "4." in context_loading list
- `quality-gate-verifier.md` rewritten with correct hook schema (prompt, agent, command options) — was using outdated fields and incorrectly claiming plugins can't register agent-type Stop hooks
- `quality-gates.md` workflow: removed misleading agent reference list from `<available_agent_types>`
- `autoskill.md` workflow: clarified that agent dispatch is conditional, not guaranteed

### Changed
- `harness/` directory removed — scripts relocated to `scripts/` (run-quality-gates.sh, check-docs.sh)
- `state/workflow.yaml` at plugin root removed (development artifact — runtime state is in `.devt/state/`)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- `/devt:help` command — full command reference with use cases, organized by experience level
- `node devt-tools.cjs health [--repair]` — CLI-based health validation with structured JSON output, 17 checks, auto-repair for safe issues, version and update status display
- Hook profile system: `DEVT_HOOK_PROFILE=minimal|standard|full` and `DEVT_DISABLED_HOOKS` env var for granular hook control
- Node.js hook runner (`hooks/run-hook.js`) — replaces bash polyglot, resolves plugin root from script location, checks profile flags
- Language-specific `review-checklist.md` for all 5 templates (Python, Go, TypeScript, Vue, blank)
- `api-changelog.md` template for Go and TypeScript (was Python-only)
- `schemas/learning-entry.yaml` — formal entry schema for retro/curator agents
- Autoskill changelog audit trail (`.devt/autoskill-changelog.md`) — records all autoskill modifications
- Ship workflow changelog step — conditional API changelog generation when `.devt/rules/api-changelog.md` exists
- `templates/agent-template.md` and `templates/skill-template.md` — authoring templates for extending devt
- Command registration via symlink to `~/.claude/commands/devt/` for proper `devt:` namespacing in autocomplete
- `context-monitor.sh` made async — no longer blocks tool calls
- Health check W009: agent file validation — verifies all plugin agent files exist on disk
- Health check W010: workflow `<available_agent_types>` enforcement — prevents post-`/clear` silent fallback to general-purpose
- `scripts/prompt-injection-scan.sh` — CI security scanner for prompt injection, role manipulation, system boundary injection, base64 obfuscation, and secret detection across all markdown files
- Repo-local CLI resolution in `run-hook.js` — probes `<projectDir>/.claude/devt/` before global fallback, persists resolved path to temp file for workflow bash blocks
- `/devt:do` smart router — freeform text dispatched to the right command via intent matching
- `/devt:session-report` — post-session summary from git log and workflow artifacts
- `bin/modules/security.cjs` — input validation: path traversal prevention, prompt injection detection, safe JSON parsing, shell argument validation
- `references/questioning-guide.md` — collaborative questioning philosophy for specify and clarify workflows

### Fixed
- Hook exit codes: `workflow-context-injector.sh` and `context-monitor.sh` now exit 0 (not 2) when inactive — prevents blocking prompts and tool calls
- Stop hook output uses correct `stopReason` schema (was using `hookSpecificOutput` which is invalid for Stop events)
- `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` path resolution: session-start hook injects the resolved absolute path so agents can substitute it in workflow bash commands
- `update status` type field collision: `dirty.type` no longer overwrites `install.type` for plugin installs
- `tier` vs `complexity` naming: workflow now writes `tier=` (not `complexity=`), matching schema, hooks, and cancel script. Legacy `complexity` normalized to `tier` on read.
- Non-atomic `stop.sh`: merged two separate `state update` calls into single atomic call
- `findProjectRoot()` memoized — eliminates redundant directory traversals per CLI call
- `checkWorkflowLock(state?)` accepts pre-read state to avoid double `readState()`
- Default model profile fallback aligned to `"quality"` everywhere (was `"balanced"` in some paths)
- Missing `plan` phase added to `VALID_PHASES`
- `architecture.md` correctly classified as required (was listed as optional in docs)
- Stale v0.2.0 migration checks removed from session-start hook
- API changelog template: Before/After labels no longer include version numbers
- Project-init: model profile selection split into own step to prevent batched AskUserQuestion errors

### Changed
- All project artifacts consolidated under `.devt/` directory:
  - `.devt.json` → `.devt/config.json`
  - `.dev-rules/` → `.devt/rules/`
  - `.devt-state/` → `.devt/state/`
  - `learning-playbook.md` → `.devt/learning-playbook.md`
- Health workflow rewritten to call CLI (deterministic) instead of agent-interpreted bash
- `DEFAULTS` exported from config.cjs — health and setup use canonical defaults
- `REQUIRED_DEV_RULES` exported from init.cjs — health imports instead of duplicating
- Atomic writes in setup.cjs via `atomicWriteJson()` helper
- `releaseLock` verifies PID ownership before unlinking (ABA prevention)
- Plugin install docs updated to `claude --plugin-dir` (correct mechanism)
- Weekly report workflow rewritten to use `devt-tools.cjs report` CLI (removed dead Python script branches)
- Incident runbook modernized — references `/devt:cancel-workflow` instead of raw scripts
- Incident runbook wired into dev-workflow.md deviation_rules for failure recovery
- `research-task.md` now has deviation_rules (was the only workflow missing them)
- `quick-implement.md` now writes `tier=SIMPLE` to state (was null, causing hooks to report unknown tier)
- `autonomous=true` state write added to dev-workflow.md when `--autonomous` flag detected
- Code-reviewer agent now reads `.devt/rules/review-checklist.md` for language-specific review patterns
- Retro and curator agents now read `schemas/learning-entry.yaml` for entry format validation

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-30
